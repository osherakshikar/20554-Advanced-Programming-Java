# Maman14 Question 1: Generic Set Implementation

## Overview
This is my solution for Question 1 of Maman14 assignment from the Advanced Programming in Java course (20554), implementing a generic set data structure.

## Description
This project implements a generic set data structure in Java that can store any type of objects. The implementation includes basic set operations like union, intersection, subset checking, and element manipulation. Additionally, it includes a utility to find the minimum element in a set.

## Implementation Details
- Generic set implementation supporting any object type
- Basic set operations (union, intersection, subset checking)
- Element manipulation (insert, delete, membership checking)
- Iterator support for traversing elements
- Utility method to find minimum element in a set

## Key Components
- `GenericSet<T>`: Core class implementing the generic set functionality
- `FindMinimum`: Utility class with a generic method to find the minimum element
- `Person`: Example class implementing Comparable interface for testing
- `Main`: Demonstration of set operations with both Integer and Person objects

## Features
- Creation of sets from arrays or empty sets
- Union operation to combine two sets
- Intersection operation between sets
- Subset checking
- Element insertion and deletion
- Membership checking
- Minimum element finding for comparable objects

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Compile the Java files: `javac *.java`
4. Run the main class: `java Main`
5. Follow the prompts to interact with the sets

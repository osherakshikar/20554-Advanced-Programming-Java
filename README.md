# Advanced Java Programming Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains my assignments for the "Advanced Java Programming" course (20554) at The Open University of Israel. Each assignment is labeled as `maman11`, `maman12`, etc., corresponding to the official coursework structure.

Each assignment involves practical implementations of advanced Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, GUI applications with JavaFX, multithreading, data structures, and network communication.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher
- JavaFX library

## Assignments Breakdown

### **[Maman 11](/Maman11)**
1. **["Bulls and Cows" Game](/Maman11/Q1%20Bulls%20and%20Cows)** – Implemented using `JavaFX Dialog` for user interaction.
2. **[Temperature Graph Visualization](/Maman11/Q2%20TemperatureProject)** – A `JavaFX` application that displays a bar chart representing the average temperature over a year, based on user input.

### **[Maman 12](/Maman12)**
1. **[Animal Class Hierarchy](/Maman12/Q1%20Animal%20Class%20Hierarchy)** – Implemented `OOP` principles, including class inheritance and `polymorphism`. Demonstrates method overriding and cloning.
2. **[Conway's Game of Life](/Maman12/Q2%20Conway's%20Game%20of%20Life)** – A graphical simulation using `JavaFX`, implementing a cellular automaton to model life cycles.

### **[Maman 13](/Maman13)**
1. **[Hangman Game](/Maman13/Q1%20Hangman%20Game)** – A `JavaFX` GUI application for the Hangman word-guessing game.
2. **[Trivia Game](/Maman13/Q2%20Trivia%20Game)** – A `JavaFX` application that loads trivia questions from a file and allows users to answer multiple-choice questions. Utilizes `file handling` and `GUI components`.

### **[Maman 14](/Maman14)**
1. **[Generic Set Implementation](/Maman14/Q1%20Generic%20Set%20Implementation)** – A `generic` class implementing set operations (`union`, `intersection`, `subset`, `insert`, `iterator`) using `ArrayList`. Also includes user interaction.
2. **[Electronic Calendar Application](/Maman14/Q2%20Electronic%20Calendar%20Application)** – A `JavaFX` GUI displaying a monthly calendar where users can select a day and manage events. Uses `HashMap` for storing event data.

### **[Maman 15](/Maman15)**
1. **[Bank Account Management System](/Maman15/Q1%20Bank%20Account%20Management%20System)** – A multi-threaded simulation of bank transactions where multiple clerks update account balances. Implements `thread synchronization` to prevent race conditions.
2. **[Parallel Merge Sort](/Maman15/Q2%20Parallel%20Merge%20Sort)** – A system that sorts an array of integers using `multi-threaded` merge sort.

### **Maman 16**
1. **Chat Room (Client-Server Communication)** – A `TCP`-based client-server chatroom where multiple users can join a session. The `JavaFX` GUI includes a text input field, message display area, participant list, and connection controls.
2. **UDP Connection Tester** – A `UDP` client-server application that sends and receives 10 unique messages to measure connection reliability. Implements `multi-threading`, with one thread for sending messages and another for receiving and displaying responses.

## How to Run
Each assignment is self-contained and can be compiled and executed separately. Ensure you have Java installed before running the programs. Instructions for each assignment can be found within its respective folder.

## Technologies Used
- `JavaFX` (GUI applications)
- `OOP` (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- `Multithreading & Synchronization`
- `Generic Programming`
- `Client-Server Communication (TCP & UDP)`

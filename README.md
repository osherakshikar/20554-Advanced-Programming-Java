# Advanced Java Programming Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains my assignments for the "Advanced Java Programming" course (20554) at The Open University of Israel. Each assignment is labeled as `mman11`, `mman12`, etc., corresponding to the official coursework structure.

Each assignment involves practical implementations of advanced Java concepts, including object-oriented programming, GUI applications with JavaFX, multithreading, data structures, and network communication.

## Assignments Breakdown

### **1. mman11 - "Bulls and Cows" Game**
- A console-based number-guessing game.
- Implements user input handling and game logic validation.

### **2. mman12 - Temperature Graph Visualization**
- JavaFX application for visualizing monthly temperature data.
- Uses bar charts with dynamic color changes.

### **3. mman13 - Inheritance and Polymorphism in Animals**
- Object-oriented hierarchy for animal classifications.
- Demonstrates inheritance, method overriding, and polymorphism.

### **4. mman14 - Custom Set Data Structure**
- Implementation of a `Set` class with operations like union, intersection, and subset checking.
- Uses generics and `Comparable` interface.

### **5. mman15 - Banking System Simulation**
- Multi-threaded simulation of bank transactions.
- Implements thread synchronization to manage account balances safely.

### **6. mman16 - Chat Room Application (Client-Server Model)**
- A network-based chat application using TCP sockets.
- Supports multiple clients and real-time messaging.
